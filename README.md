# MenuMatrix CMS Template #1

MenuMatrix CMS Template #1 is a React application designed to dynamically ingest data from a custom-built content management system (CMS), MenuMatrix CMS. Developed by Kyle Joeckel, this template provides a robust foundation for integrating with the MenuMatrix CMS, facilitating the easy management and deployment of content-driven web applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Easily update your application's content through MenuMatrix CMS without needing to directly modify your codebase.
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags and other SEO relevant data are dynamically generated based on the content managed in MenuMatrix CMS.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Available Scripts
-----------------

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!
